# PEFF (Paradise Energy Fractal Force)

The PEFF module provides a system for harmony, optimization, security, ethics, and emotional intelligence within the cognitive engine.

## Overview

The Paradise Energy Fractal Force (PEFF) enables the cognitive engine to:

- Evaluate ethical considerations of actions and decisions
- Optimize systems for harmonic balance and efficiency
- Ensure security across operations and data handling
- Process and respond with appropriate emotional intelligence
- Guide decision-making based on ethical principles

## Components

- `engine.py`: Core integration methods for PEFF functionality
- `__init__.py`: Module initialization and exports

## Usage

```python
from cognitive_engine.peff import ParadiseEnergyFractalForce

# Initialize PEFF
peff = ParadiseEnergyFractalForce()

# Evaluate ethics of an action
ethics_result = peff.evaluate_ethics({
    "action_type": "data_access",
    "target": "user_information",
    "purpose": "recommendation"
})

# Optimize for harmony in a system
harmony_result = peff.optimize_harmony({
    "components": ["memory", "reasoning", "perception"],
    "metrics": {"efficiency": 0.7, "accuracy": 0.8, "adaptability": 0.6}
})

# Assess security of an operation
security_assessment = peff.assess_security(
    {"operation": "external_api_call", "destination": "third_party_service"},
    ["user_data", "api_credentials"]
)

# Process emotional response
emotion_response = peff.process_emotion(
    {"type": "user_feedback", "sentiment": "negative", "intensity": 0.8},
    {"current_mood": "neutral", "trust_level": 0.6}
)
```

## Ethical Framework

PEFF operates based on a multi-layered ethical framework that considers:

- Universal ethical principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice)
- Context-specific considerations
- Cultural sensitivities
- Long-term impacts of decisions
- Alignment with human values

## Integration Points

The PEFF module integrates with:

- Fractal system to represent ethical structures and relationships
- Code Execution for ethical guidance in code operations
- Memory system to maintain ethical consistency over time
- Probabilistic system for uncertainty handling in ethical decisions
