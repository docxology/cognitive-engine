# Code Execution Module

The Code Execution module provides capabilities for executing and operating code within the cognitive engine's own repository and other repositories.

## Overview

This module enables the cognitive engine to:

- Execute code in various environments safely
- Analyze code structure, dependencies, and potential issues
- Manage code repositories and execution environments
- Provide feedback on code quality and performance

## Components

- `engine.py`: Core integration methods for code execution functionality
- `__init__.py`: Module initialization and exports

## Usage

```python
from cognitive_engine.code_execution import CodeExecutor

# Initialize the code executor
executor = CodeExecutor()

# Execute code
result = executor.execute("print('Hello, World!')", environment="python")

# Analyze code
analysis = executor.analyze("def factorial(n): return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial(n-1)")

# Register a new environment
executor.register_environment({
    "name": "python3.9",
    "type": "container",
    "image": "python:3.9",
    "security": "isolated"
})

# Register a repository
executor.register_repository({
    "name": "my-project",
    "url": "https://github.com/username/my-project",
    "branch": "main"
})
```

## Security Considerations

Code execution is performed in isolated environments to ensure security. The module includes mechanisms to:

- Restrict access to sensitive system resources
- Limit execution time and resource usage
- Validate code before execution
- Monitor for potentially harmful operations

## Integration Points

The Code Execution module integrates with:

- Memory system to store and retrieve code snippets
- Fractal system to represent code structures symbolically
- PEFF for ethical considerations in code execution
