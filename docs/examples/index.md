## Integration Examples

### Memory System Integration

Example demonstrating advanced memory operations:

- Different memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- Memory consolidation processes
- Forgetting curves and memory optimization
- Associative memory networks

```python
# Store information in memory
engine.memory_system.store(
    content="Important information",
    metadata={"topic": "example", "importance": 0.8}
)

# Create memory associations
engine.memory_system.create_association(
    source_id="memory1",
    target_id="memory2",
    association_type="related_to",
    strength=0.75
)

# Retrieve with associations
related_memories = engine.memory_system.find_related(
    memory_id="memory1",
    association_types=["related_to"],
    max_distance=2
)
```

### Neural-Symbolic Integration

Example showcasing the integration between neural and symbolic systems:

- Symbol grounding with neural representations
- Translating between natural language and symbolic structures
- Using neural systems to guide symbolic reasoning
- Combining symbolic and neural predictions

```python
# Process text with neural system
neural_result = engine.neural_system.process("Climate change is affecting global ecosystems")

# Extract symbolic information
symbols = engine.neural_to_symbolic_translator.extract_symbols(neural_result)

# Add to symbolic system
for symbol in symbols:
    engine.symbolic_system.add_symbol(symbol, layer=3)

# Perform hybrid reasoning
result = engine.hybrid_reason(
    query="How will climate change affect agricultural production?",
    symbolic_steps=["decompose", "structure"],
    neural_steps=["elaborate", "evaluate"]
)
```

## Domain-Specific Examples

### Scientific Discovery

Example demonstrating the use of the Cognitive Engine for scientific discovery:

- Analyzing scientific literature
- Finding potential knowledge gaps
- Generating hypotheses
- Designing experiments
- Evaluating results

```python
# Analyze scientific domain
domain_knowledge = engine.analyze_domain("quantum_physics")

# Identify knowledge gaps
gaps = engine.identify_knowledge_gaps(domain_knowledge)

# Generate hypotheses
hypotheses = engine.generate_hypotheses(gaps[0])

# Design experiments
experiments = engine.design_experiments(hypotheses[0])
```

### Creative Generation

Example showing how to use the Cognitive Engine for creative generation:

- Cross-domain analogical mapping
- Pattern-based generation
- Concept blending
- Evaluation of creative outputs

```python
# Create analogical mapping
mapping = engine.create_analogical_mapping(
    source_domain="music",
    target_domain="visual_art"
)

# Generate creative concepts
concepts = engine.generate_concepts_from_mapping(mapping)

# Blend concepts
blended_concept = engine.blend_concepts([concepts[0], concepts[2]])

# Evaluate creativity
creativity_score = engine.evaluate_creativity(blended_concept)
```

## Advanced Integration Examples

### Web Research Integration

Example demonstrating web research capabilities:

- Searching for information
- Processing search results
- Extracting structured knowledge
- Integrating with existing knowledge

```python
# Research a topic
research_results = engine.research_topic(
    "recent advances in fusion energy",
    depth=2
)

# Extract knowledge
knowledge = engine.extract_knowledge_from_research(research_results)

# Integrate with existing knowledge
engine.integrate_knowledge(knowledge)
```

### Continuous Learning

Example showing continuous learning capabilities:

- Learning from new information
- Adapting to feedback
- Evolving symbolic structures
- Performance improvement over time

```python
# Enable continuous learning
engine.enable_continuous_learning()

for query in queries:
    result = engine.process(query)
    
    # Provide feedback
    engine.provide_feedback(
        response_id=result['id'],
        feedback_score=calculate_score(result)
    )

# Evaluate learning progress
learning_metrics = engine.evaluate_learning_progress()
